            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project is designed exclusively for educational purposes and aims to provide a practical learning experience in web application development using a range of modern technologies. It utilizes the ASP.NET MVC framework to build a robust and scalable web application, while the Web API component enables the creation of RESTful services for data access and manipulation.

            <h2>Key Technologies Used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><i class="fas fa-pager"></i> <strong>ASP.NET MVC:</strong> The project leverages ASP.NET MVC to structure the application in a way that separates concerns, promoting a clean, maintainable codebase and facilitating a better user experience through a model-view-controller architecture.</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-plug"></i> <strong>Web API:</strong> RESTful APIs are implemented using ASP.NET Web API, allowing for efficient and flexible communication between the client and server. This setup supports the development of client-server applications where data can be accessed and manipulated via HTTP requests.</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-database"></i> <strong>Entity Framework (EF):</strong> Entity Framework is used as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool to simplify data access. EF provides an abstraction layer over the database, allowing for easier querying and management of data using .NET objects.</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-server"></i> <strong>Microsoft SQL Server:</strong> The project employs Microsoft SQL Server as the relational database management system to store and manage data. SQL Server's capabilities ensure reliable data storage and efficient querying.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The primary goal of this project is to facilitate learning and experimentation with these technologies. It serves as a practical exercise for understanding how to integrate and use ASP.NET MVC, Web API, Entity Framework, and SQL Server within a single application framework. This project is not intended for production use but rather as a valuable resource for students and developers to gain hands-on experience and deepen their understanding of web application development.
